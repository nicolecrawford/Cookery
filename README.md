# Cookery
My final project for CS193P

I created an iOS app for iPhone and iPad that can be used for
* Searching for recipes
* Adding recipes to your cookbook
* Planning meals
* Keeping track of steps while cooking
* Setting reminders to cook meals & buy groceries

I used the [Spoonacular API][1] to support the recipe search.
